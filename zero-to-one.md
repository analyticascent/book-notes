# Zero to One

&nbsp;

#### Preface:

* Copying == going from 1 to N
* Innovation == going from 0 to 1
* Doing something better < Doing something different
* Technology allows us to do more with less
* Every innovation is new/unique, so formula for success hard to pin down

&nbsp;

### 1. The Challenge of the Future:

* **"What important truth do very few people agree with you on?"**
* *"Most people believe X, but the truth is the opposite of X."*
* Most incomplete answers to the contrarian question are different ways of seeing the present
* Horizontal vs Vertical progress, globalization vs new technology
* Thiel's answer: **Technology matters more than globalization**
* Technology is anti-zero sum compared to raw agriculture alone
* Startup == largest group of people you can convince to build different plan for the future

&nbsp;

### 2. Party Like It's 1999:

* Answering the contrarian question begins with asking *what everyone agrees on*
* **Paypal growth strategy:** *Pay people noticable sum to sign up, tiny but ongoing transaction fees*
* Dot-com bubble meant people left "clicks" and went back to "bricks" as investments - real estate bubble
* **The real lessons the startup world should've learned:**

    1. Better to risk boldness than triviality
    2. Bad plan is better than no plan
    3. Competitive markets destroy profits
    4. Sales matter as much as product

&nbsp;

### 3. All Happy Companies Are Different:

* Business version of CQ: *What valuable company is nobody building?*
* Creating value isn't enough, must *capture* some of the value created
* Consider airline company profits (market value) vs Google (market captured)
* **Perfect competition:** *No company ends up making any real profit*
* **Differentiated monopoly:** *A firm so good at what it does, there isn't a substitute*
* Whether Google == monopoly depends on market you classify it under (search vs advertising)
* Non-differentiated companies overfit certain features to claim they're more unique overall
* Fewer competitors means more focus on workers, products, and wider impact on the world
* Differentiated monopoly profits only bad in a world where nothing ever changes
* Static world == Monopolist is a rent collector, Dynamic world == new categories of abundance
* Government *creates* monopolies (patents) and also hunts them down (antitrust cases)
* Distinctiveness of new "monopolies"  are why the old ones don't necessarily strangle innovation
* iOS distinct enough to take market share from Microsoft, which itself took market share from IBM
* Perfect competition easy to model, that doesn't make it better for economies overall (heat death)

&nbsp;

### 4. Ideology of Competition:

* Ellison believed it was good to have an enemy that simply *appeared* threatening as an incentive
* If you can't beat a rival, it may be better to merge with them altogether

&nbsp;

### 5. Last Mover Advantage:

* Not enough to escape competition - a business must endure in the future as well
* Great businesses (and present valuations) are defined by future cash flow patterns
* *"The value of a business today is the sum of all the money it will make in the future"*
* Low-growth businesses typically make most money in near-term (nightclubs, restaurants)
* Tech companies are opposite - they often *lose* money for the first few years, delayed revenue
* Companies must *grow* and *endure* - former is easy to measure, hence why it's most hyped
* **Company Durability:** *Proprietary tech, network effects, economies of scale, and branding*
* **Proprietary tech:** Must be *10x better* than closest substitute in *important dimension* to matter
* Easiest way to do the above is to do something totally new, otherwise improve existing option(s)
* Amazon with 10x as many books + ease of finding them is a key example of a 10x improvement
* **Network effects:** Product becomes more useful as more people use it, critical for durability
* A product still has to be valuable to the very first users before you can even grow network effects
* **Economies of Scale:** Cost structure improves as it gets bigger, fixed costs per sale must drop
* **Branding:** This is a monopoly by definition, but the brand must be strong (Apple for instance)
* Do not begin with brand instead of substance, no company can be built on branding alone (Fyre...)
* Every startup should start with a very small market, and too small is better than too large
* Keep in mind that small market should *not mean non-existent,* or one you *can't branch from* later
* Paypal did the above by starting with about 25% of eBay's "PowerSellers" after 3 months of effort
* Easier for them to target a *few thousand* people who *needed Paypal* than millions of random people
* *"Capture small % of big market"* either lacks a good starting point or is open to many competitors
* **Scaling:** knowing when you dominate niche, gradually expanding into related but broader markets
* Amazon: expand *# of people* who read books, or the variety of *things they sold* (they did the latter)
* eBay limit: auction model only works for distinctive commodity products, not pencils or Kleenex
* *Sequencing markets* is underrated but still very important when expanding overall sales
* **Don't disrupt:** If a company is summed by opposition to existing firms, it's not completely new
* Paypal never *directly challenged* large competitors, they expanded payment market (helped Visa too)
* To be durable in long run, it's better to make the *last great development* (last mover) in specific market

&nbsp;

### 6. You Are Not A Lottery Ticket:

* *"Success is largely the product of luck"* poorly explains serial entrepreneurs (non-random distribution)
* If you truly believed success is largely a matter of luck, you wouldn't be reading the book (or these notes)
* "Well-roundedness" in education is an example of an "indefinite" view of things that lacks any real focus
* Definite view favors firm convictions - such as finding the one best thing to do and acting on that belief
* **Indefinite Pessimism:** Sees a bleak future, but has no idea what to do in response to it
* **Definite Pessimism:** Believes the future can be known, but since it's bleak, must prepare for it
* **Definite Optimism:** Thinks the future will be better than the present if planning/work is done for it
* **Indefinite Optimism:** Believes the future will be better, but he doesn't know how, so doesn't plan for it
* Definitively optimistic future need engineers designing underwater cities, space settlements (examples)
* Indefinitively optimistic future consists of more bankers and lawyers, no concrete planning at all
* Biotech often puts too much focus on things that "just might work" (indefinite) rather than careful planning
* Careful planning beats random chance, Steve Jobs skipped the "minimum viable product" entirely with Apple
* Big companies often offer too much/too little when acquiring a startup and founder plans are a key reason
* Founders sell company when they're out of ideas (overpaid), definite founders w/plans don't sell (underpaid)
* *"Okay, guys, this is just a formality, it shouldn't take more than 10 minutes. **We're obviously not going to sell here.**"*
* **A startup is the largest endeavor over which you can have definite mastery. Reject chance, you are not a lottery ticket**

&nbsp;

### 7. Follow the Money:

* Never underestimate exponential growth (example: Einstein still gets credit for things he never said)
* Small minorities often achieve disproportionate results: **Pareto principle, or 80-20 rule, Price's Law**
* The lesson is that differentiated businesses capture more value than millions of undifferentiated ones
* VCs aim to profit from promising early-stage companies, if successful they take roughly 20% of profits
* Because of high failure rate of startups, most venture funds lose money at first, but aim to break even
* Venture returns not normally distributed, company outcomes follow a power law that, most are flops
* At Founders Fund: Facebook worth more than all others, Palantir worth more than all but Facebook
* **Every single company in a venture portfolio should potentially return investment in all firms**
* Most VCs overlook the power law because it only becomes visible over time + short-term focus
* After a decade, portfolio won't be divided between winners/losers, but one investment/everything else
* VCs often don't want to give up on an investment, so they waste time trying to fix problematic ones
* Less than 1% of new firms each year receive venture funding, VC investment < 0.2% of US GDP
* **Disproportionate returns:** 11% of private sector jobs, 21% of GDP, 12 largest tech > sum of all others
* Power law matters in life too - can't effectively keep dozens of equally possible careers in ready reserve
* Instead, focus on something you're good at doing, but think about whether it will remain valuable later
* Differences between *companies* will dwarf differences in *roles within them* - joining can beat starting
* Owning 100% of nothing in a company you tried to start < 0.01% of Google (especially sooner you get it)
* With startups, one market will probably be better than all others (power law)

&nbsp;

### 8. Secrets:

* That which is taken for granted today was once unknown/unsuspected, secrets are knowledge to be found
* *"What valuable company is nobody building?" - answer is a secret: important + unknown, hard + doable
* Classic trichotomy of the easy, the hard, and the impossible, Unabomber thought all hard problems solved
* **Why people no longer believe in secrets:** *Incrementalism, risk aversion, complacency, flatness*
* **Incrementalism:** Schools rarely reward students for going above and beyond, same w/tenure tracks
* **Risk Aversion:** People are scared of secrets because scared of being wrong - and *alone* in that regard
* **Complacency:** Why search for secret when you can collect rents on everything that's already been done
* **Flatness:** Given globalization, many think someone out there has already found given secret, or will soon
* The only optimistic result of these trends are that it's now far harder to start a cult
* Saying we live in a world of no secrets is to also imply that there are no hidden injustices either
* HP's decline can largely be attributed to not continuing the production of new products, mostly consulting
* Tom Perkins believed HP should identify promising new technologies, Patricia Dunn thought otherwise
* Collaborative consumption apps/services saw dormant capital as an untapped secret, not just reinvention
* Two kinds of secrets - secrets of nature (math/physics/chem/bio) and secrets about people (don't know or hide)
* Secrets about people underappreciated in part because heavy education isn't necessary to find/know them
* Fields that matter but haven't been standardized/institutionalized often contain secrets worth finding
* Unless your beliefs are conventional, it's normally not a good idea to tell everyone everything you know
* Only tell people those secrets on a need-to-know basis, best firms built around secrets hidden from outside

&nbsp;

### 9. Foundations:

* Thiel's law: *a startup messed up at the foundations cannot be fixed later on
* Most crucial decision will be who your co-founder is, must be compatible in the long-term
* When investing in a startup, Thiel studies the founding teams: what they know, how they work together
* **Anticipating sources of misalignment among company employees:**
    1. Ownership: usually in the form of equity
    2. Possession: who runs the firm on a day-by-day basis
    3. Control: who governs the affairs of the company
* Ownership among founders/employees/investors, possion by managers/employees, board of founders/investors control
* DMV dysfunctional because public "ownership" is nothing but, accountable to no one and misaligned with everyone
* Big firms prone to misalignment, early-stage startups small enough for founders to have ownership and possession
* Smaller board sizes are ideal for alignment, but small size means they can oppose management if conflict arises
* Board of three ideal, not to exceed five - but public companies must follow government mandates for board size
* Everyone should 100% commit to firm (stock options, regular salary), exceptions include lawyers and accountants
* Consultants, part-time employees, etc biased to claim value in near-term and not future company growth
* Startups often do better the less they pay the CEO, *under $150K* is ideal otherwise they'll favor status quo
* Low CEO pay sets standard for everyone else, emphasizing non-cash compensation emphasizes long-term growth
* Equity should not be *equally* distributed, it's arbitrary and doesn't reflect individual differences/circumstances
* Not possible to be 100% fair with equity allocation, early employees risk more, keep ownership stake secret
* Equity is tied to a specific company and the growth of that company over time, dedicated people will prefer it
* If you get the founding moment right, you can go beyond a valuable company and beyond inherited success

&nbsp;

### 10. The Mechanics of Mafia:

* Company culture should not be reducible to just the absurd perks that Silicon Valley firms are known for
* **Paypal Mafia:** All later founded/co-founded companies worth over a billion each
    1. **Elon Musk:** SpaceX and Tesla
    2. **Reid Hoffman:** LinkedIn
    3. **Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, Jawed Karim:** YouTube
    4. **Jeremy Stoppelman, Russel Simmons:** Yelp
    5. **David Sacks:** Yammer
    6. **Peter Thiel:** Palantir
* Paypal didn't sort through resumes and find most "talented" people as their sole hiring strategy
* Companies should strive to hire people that will have long-term prospects with each other even outside the firm
* Do not outsource recruiting, it's a core competency for any company and people need to be cohesive after hiring
* High-skilled employees have plenty of options, you must find reasons that distinguish your firm from others
* Reasons often boil down to the company mission and the team seeking to carry it out, answers will vary by firm
* Do not fight the perk war, you can't be the Google of today by that standard, but you can aim for Google of 1999
* Everyone in a company should be different in the same way, early staff should be as personally similar as possible
* Everyone should be especially focused on one particular thing, roles must be well-defined to reduce conflict
* Startups are vulnerable to task conflict because roles are often more fluid, eliminate that competition
* Cults are pure dedication, consulting firms are the opposite with no distinctive mission, startups closer to former
* A cult is *wrong* about something crucial while people at a startup are *right* about a secret but important truth

&nbsp;

### 11. If You Build It, Will They Come?

* Distribution matters, you can't expect to rely entirely on building a product that sells itself
* US ad industry in 2014 had an annual revenue of $150 billion and employed over 600,000 people
* US sales industry is even bigger at $450 billion and with 3.2 million employees, engineers skeptical of need
* Engineers skeptical of advertising because they think it's irrational, but it matters because it works
* Sales is less transparent than engineering, sales is about changing appearences but not underlying reality
* Salesmen are actors focused on persuasion, we typically focus on the awkward obvious salesmen for bad rep
* Sales works best when hidden, and most people involved have job titles that don't seem related to it
* Path dependence: specific circumstances can lead to one product winning over another regardless of quality
* Better sales and distribution can lead to monopoly even without product differentiation, but not vice versa
* **Two metrics help shape effective distribution:** Customer Lifetime Value must exceed Customer Acquisition Cost
* Complex sales (to big firms, governments, etc) can take months to make right relationships, infrequent (SpaceX)
* With complex sales, salesmen are usually not a set role and someone such as the CEO
