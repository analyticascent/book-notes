# Zero to One

&nbsp;

#### Preface:

* Copying == going from 1 to N
* Innovation == going from 0 to 1
* Doing something better < Doing something different
* Technology allows us to do more with less
* Every innovation is new/unique, so formula for success hard to pin down

&nbsp;

### 1. The Challenge of the Future:

* **"What important truth do very few people agree with you on?"**
* *"Most people believe X, but the truth is the opposite of X."*
* Most incomplete answers to the contrarian question are different ways of seeing the present
* Horizontal vs Vertical progress, globalization vs new technology
* Thiel's answer: **Technology matters more than globalization**
* Technology is anti-zero sum compared to raw agriculture alone
* Startup == largest group of people you can convince to build different plan for the future

&nbsp;

### 2. Party Like It's 1999:

* Answering the contrarian question begins with asking *what everyone agrees on*
* **Paypal growth strategy:** *Pay people noticable sum to sign up, tiny but ongoing transaction fees*
* Dot-com bubble meant people left "clicks" and went back to "bricks" as investments - real estate bubble
* **The real lessons the startup world should've learned:**

    1. Better to risk boldness than triviality
    2. Bad plan is better than no plan
    3. Competitive markets destroy profits
    4. Sales matter as much as product

&nbsp;

### 3. All Happy Companies Are Different:

* Business version of CQ: *What valuable company is nobody building?*
* Creating value isn't enough, must *capture* some of the value created
* Consider airline company profits (market value) vs Google (market captured)
* **Perfect competition:** *No company ends up making any real profit*
* **Differentiated monopoly:** *A firm so good at what it does, there isn't a substitute*
* Whether Google == monopoly depends on market you classify it under (search vs advertising)
* Non-differentiated companies overfit certain features to claim they're more unique overall
* Fewer competitors means more focus on workers, products, and wider impact on the world
* Differentiated monopoly profits only bad in a world where nothing ever changes
* Static world == Monopolist is a rent collector, Dynamic world == new categories of abundance
* Government *creates* monopolies (patents) and also hunts them down (antitrust cases)
* Distinctiveness of new "monopolies"  are why the old ones don't necessarily strangle innovation
* iOS distinct enough to take market share from Microsoft, which itself took market share from IBM
* Perfect competition easy to model, that doesn't make it better for economies overall (heat death)

&nbsp;

### 4. Ideology of Competition:

* Ellison believed it was good to have an enemy that simply *appeared* threatening as an incentive
* If you can't beat a rival, it may be better to merge with them altogether

&nbsp;

### 5. Last Mover Advantage:
