# Book Notes
Markdown files (and printer-friendly PDFs) of key bullet points from books I've felt the need to read more than a few times. The bullet points are basically the equivalent to "sticky note" highlights I already made in physical copies I own.

These are for jogging my memory of book content to reduce the need to read something more than once. To fully benefit from these files, you will still have to read the respective books at least once.
